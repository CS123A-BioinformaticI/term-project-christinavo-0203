## Overview
Using machine learning to analyze protein sequences across multiple families to check similarities between them.

## Setup
Use git clone to clone the repo

## Installations
Install the pip packages in requirements.txt

## Dataset Preparation
Ensure that FASTA files are in the data folder, separating the families into different folders
<br>
Run organize_dataset.py in order to prepare the dataset
<br>
Run question1.py to see visualizations for Question 1
<br>
Run question2.py to see visualizations for Question 2
<br>
Run question3.py to see visualizations for Question 3
<br>
Run question4.py to see visualizations for Question 4
<br>
Run question5.py to see visualizations for Question 5

## Machine Learning
Open Jupyter Notebook to run the machine learning models
<br>
Run LinearRegression.ipynb to run the Linear Regression Model
<br>
Run RandomForestRegressor.ipynb to run the Random Forest Regression Model
