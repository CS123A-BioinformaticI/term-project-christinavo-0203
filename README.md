## Overview
Using machine learning to analyze protein sequences across multiple families to check similarities between them.

## Setup
Use git clone to clone the repo

## Installations
Install the pip packages in requirements.txt

## Dataset Preparation
Run organize_dataset.py in order to prepare the dataset
Run question1.py to see visualizations for Question 1
Run question2.py to see visualizations for Question 2
Run question3.py to see visualizations for Question 3
Run question4.py to see visualizations for Question 4
Run question5.py to see visualizations for Question 5

## Machine Learning
Open Jupyter Notebook to run the machine learning models
Run LinearRegression.ipynb to run the Linear Regression Model
Run RandomForestRegressor.ipynb to run the Random Forest Regression Model
